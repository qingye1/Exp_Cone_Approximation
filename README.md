## Introduction
This folder contains the datasets and source code (i.e. .py files) used in the paper “Second-Order Conic and Polyhedral Approximations of the Exponential Cone: Application to Mixed-Integer Exponential Conic Programs.” To successfully run the code in subfolders, you may need to install Python.

Below is the detailed explanation of each subfolder.

## Subfolder: Packing_MIECP
- **Purpose:** The proposed second-order conic and polyhedral approximation methods were implemented to solve the packing MIECP problem and compare with MOSEK. 
- **Source Code Info:** The code folder Packing_MIECP_Binary includes eleven .py files. The code folder Packing_MIECP_Mixed_Integer includes ten .py files.

## Subfolder: Covering_MIECP
- **Purpose:** The proposed second-order conic and polyhedral approximation methods were implemented to solve the covering MIECP problem and compare with MOSEK. 
- **Source Code Info:** The code folder Covering_MIECP_Binary includes eleven .py files. The code folder Covering_MIECP_Mixed_Integer includes ten .py files.

## Subfolder: Sparse_Logistic_Regression
- **Purpose:** The proposed second-order conic and polyhedral approximation methods were implemented to solve the sparse logistic regression problem and compare with MOSEK. 
- **Data Set Info:** The two datasets are "student.xlsx" and "oral_toxicity.xlsx". The source data are available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php.
- **Source Code Info:** The code folder Sparse_Logistic_Regression_Student includes three .py files. The code folder Sparse_Logistic_Regression_Oral includes two .py files.
